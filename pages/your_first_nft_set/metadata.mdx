# 📄 Adding metadata

NFTs signify ownership of a non-fungible asset on a blockchain.
However, these tokens inherently lack data; to give these tokens meaningful representation, they require associated metadata.
Metadata normally includes media (image or video), a name, and various other properties.

## Setting up sample metadata

For the sake of simplicity, we've setup metadata for the NFT contract we just wrote.
NFT metadata is just JSON data that includes a pointer to some media and some attributes.
Here's what our sample metadata looks like:

```json
{
  "image": "ipfs://QmRmuCkoz1DAobvB9fofe4RekB9sgjuy5gujDVv4u4FzSM",
  "name": "My First NFT"
}
```

The first field is an image that points to a location in [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/).
Most dApps that interact with NFTs recognize this data format, and will fetch the image from IPFS to render it on the frontend.
We've also included a name field that apps can use for display purposes.

To save you time and money, we've uploaded this sample metadata to IPFS already.
The IPFS pointer is `ipfs://QmRmuCkoz1DAobvB9fofe4RekB9sgjuy5gujDVv4u4FzSM`.

## Adding metadata to our contract

All we need to do now is change our NFT contract to point to this metadata in its `tokenURI` function.
Here's what the new contract will look like:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.21;

import "erc721a/ERC721A.sol";

contract MyFirstFrameNFT is ERC721A {
    constructor() ERC721A("MyFirstFrameNFT", "FIRST") {}

    function mint(uint256 quantity) external {
        _mint(msg.sender, quantity);
    }

    function tokenURI(uint256) public view override returns (string memory) {
        return "ipfs://QmRmuCkoz1DAobvB9fofe4RekB9sgjuy5gujDVv4u4FzSM";
    }
}
```

This `tokenURI` function returns the same metadata for every token id.
For real contracts, you'll most likely want to return different metadata for each token id.
